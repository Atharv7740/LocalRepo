# now i can use both github and vscode to transfer file 

Use git pull origin main to pull file from origin main


git pull origin main 
or
git pull -u origin main
after this next time u don't need to write origin main just write git pull;


# to set origin we use 

git remote add  origin "origin link/ repository link"
